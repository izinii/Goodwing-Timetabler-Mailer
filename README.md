## To run the code
Please know that for now, **Google service** is used. This means that you can **ONLY** send emails from a **Google account**. 
It can be changed later to Outlook service. 

### **1- Set up your email credentials**
You need to enable "App Passwords" on your Google account to be able to send emails automatically: 
- Go to Google Security
- Enable "2-Step Verification"
- Generate an App Password for "Mail"
- Save this password for later

### **2- Update the code (`send_emails.py`):**
file_path = "path_to_the_file/name_of_the_file.xlsx" 
EMAIL_SENDER = "your.email@gmail.com"  # Replace with your email
EMAIL_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"  # Replace with your generated app password
